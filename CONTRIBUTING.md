# DBug

#### Please not that this is a work in progress and nothing is final, there is a lot to come!

DBug is a free and open source Godot Engine addon, governed under the permissive MIT license.

DBug is the ultimate all in one solution for debugging and testing your Godot project!
It allows you to log your project when you want and remove all debug lines when you are ready to ship.
DBug also features An ingame console for testing purposes as well as an ingame debug overlay!

This will be the first all-in-one tool for Godot project testing/debugging!
